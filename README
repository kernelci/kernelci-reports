Kernel CI Stable Report Emails
==============================

This is an additional feature for kernelci.org.

The aim of this project is to create a system for parsing email subjects and
acting upon the information contained in them.

Its main goal is to send, in reply to the original message received, the
build & boot reports for the "requested" tree-kernel.

It is not intended to keep track of patches.
